## **📂 File Structure**

```
todo-list-python/
│
├── task.py         # Handles task-related functionalities (add, delete, and update tasks)
├── todo.py         # Main file that sets up the Tkinter GUI and integrates the app's logic
├── tasks.json      # Stores tasks and their status in a JSON format (persistent data storage)
└── requirements.txt # Optional (if you need to list any dependencies for the project)
```

- **task.py**: Contains all core functions related to task management such as adding, deleting, and updating tasks.
- **todo.py**: The main script that creates the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and integrates the task management functions.
- **tasks.json**: A JSON file used to store the task data and their completion status, ensuring data persistence across app sessions.
